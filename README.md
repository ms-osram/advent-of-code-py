# Advent of Code

## Introduction

Advent of Code is an annual online event created by Eric Wastl. It is a series of programming puzzles that are released daily during the month of December, leading up to Christmas. The event has gained popularity among programmers, developers, and coding enthusiasts worldwide.

## Purpose

The primary goal of Advent of Code is to provide an entertaining and challenging platform for individuals to improve their problem-solving skills, programming abilities, and creativity. The puzzles are designed to cover a wide range of topics, algorithms, and data structures, making it a great opportunity to learn and practice different programming techniques.

## Structure

Each year, Advent of Code introduces a new set of challenges, and participants have the opportunity to solve one puzzle per day. The puzzles are divided into two parts: Part 1 and Part 2, with the difficulty level often increasing in Part 2. The puzzles are designed to be language-agnostic, allowing participants to solve them using any programming language they prefer.

## Obtaining Puzzles

To participate in Advent of Code, you can visit the official [Advent of Code website](adventofcode.com) starting from December 1st. Each day, a new puzzle is unlocked at midnight Eastern Standard Time (UTC-5:00). The puzzles remain accessible throughout the event, allowing participants to catch up if they missed a few days.

## Submitting Solutions

Participants are encouraged to submit their solutions for each puzzle to earn points. The scoring system varies each year, but generally, points are awarded based on the time taken to solve the puzzle. However, points are not the main focus of the event; the real value lies in the learning experience and the satisfaction of solving the puzzles.

## Sharing and Community

Advent of Code has a vibrant and active community. Participants often gather on forums, social media platforms, and coding communities to discuss the puzzles, share their approaches, and help each other. Many participants even stream their coding sessions or create blog posts and videos to showcase their solutions, insights, and experiences throughout the event.

## Repository Contents

This repository serves as a compilation of my solutions for Advent of Code using Python programming language, organized by year. The structure of this repository is designed to help easily navigate and locate solutions for specific puzzles. 

Please note that these solutions are based on my personal efforts and understanding of the puzzles. They may not be the most efficient or optimal solutions, but they represent my progress and growth as a programmer throughout the Advent of Code event.

Feel free to explore the repository, review my solutions, and compare them with your own. Please keep in mind that these solutions are for personal reference and learning purposes only, and that there are often multiple valid approaches to solving these puzzles, and learning from different perspectives can be valuable.. Avoid copying or plagiarizing code from this repository or any other external source without proper attribution or authorization.

I hope these solutions can serve as a useful resource for you in your coding journey. Happy coding and enjoy Advent of Code!
